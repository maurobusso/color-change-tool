# Colour changer 

This app allows you to pick a colour and then with the use of a button chose a darker or brighter shade displaying also the hexadecimal value. I have built this project as a part of the module about "Build a color tool in vanilla JavaScript" module from Scrimba.

I started this project by building the HTML and CSS having a visual reference of how i wanted it to look like. Then the JavaScript was build starting with the function that checks if the input is a valid hexadecimal value. Then the conversion of this value in RGB value which allow me to increase it by a certain percentage and then again convert the value to hexadecimal and display the associated colour in the box below.

#

Optimizations: 

The UX interface could be improved with a smoother design. Another optimization that could be introduced is the use of the actual name of the colour as an input value rather than accepting only hexadecimal values.

#

Lessons Learned: 

Through this project i had the opportunity to learn the hexadecimal and RGB value and how to convert them between each other. I also had practice with the DOM manipulation and create a customized toggle button.
